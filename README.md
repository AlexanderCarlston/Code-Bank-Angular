## Intro

This project started as my capstone project for Galvanize, a end of class project where I dived in to unfimilar technologies to make a Miniumum Viable Product that I would show case in front of an audience. I succesfully completed this, but didn't have the experience to fully flesh out my idea. After 7 months of experience I'm coming back to make the complete product that I wanted to when I started this project.

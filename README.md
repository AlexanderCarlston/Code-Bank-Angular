## Intro

This project started as my capstone project for Galvanize, a end of class project where I dived in to unfimilar technologies to make a Miniumum Viable Product that I would show case in front of an audience. I succesfully completed this, but didn't have the experience to fully flesh out my idea. After 7 months of experience I'm coming back to make the complete product that I wanted to when I started this project.

## Original Vue Project

https://github.com/AlexanderCarlston/CODE-BANK
<br>
This is the original project done in Vue/Vuex/Vuetify and more. I'm starting a job in Angular 7 so that's the reason why I'm switching to the current technology.

## MVP Functionality
As a user I want to be able to import my gists from Github. (OAuth sign in)
As a user I want to be able to select which gists I import. 
As a user I want to be able to store my gists from Github.

## Design Inspiration

Since I'm using Clarity Design, I decided to use their documentation for inspiration. I used their header as an example of how to do a responsive header.
